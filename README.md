# Machine Learning Group Project
## Monitoring Iberian Plant Diversity through a Collection-based Mobile Application 

In this project we intent to set up the groundworks for the development on a mobile application that allows the user to collect vegetation species in augmented reality. The backbone will be a machine learning model that allows for the classification of user-taken images, that allows them to unlock new features in the online world.
