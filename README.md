# Machine Learning Group Project
## TreeID: Monitoring Portuguese Plant Diversity through a Collection-based Mobile Application 

In this project we intent to set up the groundworks for the development on a mobile application that allows the user to collect vegetation species in augmented reality. The backbone will be a machine learning model that allows for the classification of user-taken images, that allows them to unlock new features in the online world. 

Through trial and error, two machine learning methods were developed to achieve the goal of our app; one with the pre-existing foundation model ResNet and one without.

Both models' deployment on HuggingFace is in the following link, as well as the trending function of our app: [TreeID Models](https://huggingface.co/Diogo-Janice-Rafael)

The app we invision will not only efficiently run our models, but also have many interactive features to maintain our user interest and encourage more plant species data collection.
